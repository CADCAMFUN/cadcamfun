CAD/CAM FUN

An innovative web platform for 2D/3D design, parametric modeling, and CNC machine control with advanced AI integration.

🌟 Overview

CAD/CAM FUN is a comprehensive web application that combines CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) functionalities in a modern, intuitive interface. The platform provides powerful tools to create, edit, and manufacture projects, with built-in AI assistance for optimal productivity.

Key Features
	•	Integrated CAD/CAM Environment: Seamless transition from design to production
	•	Advanced 2D/3D Modeling: Create and edit both 2D drawings and complex 3D models
	•	AI-Assisted Design: Use artificial intelligence to generate components, optimize toolpaths, and enhance designs
	•	Organization & Collaboration: Manage projects, components, and teams with version control
	•	CNC Machine Integration: Generate and validate G-code for various types of industrial machines
	•	Complete Material & Tool Libraries: Access standard components and customize your own
	•	Modern Web Interface: Responsive design with light and dark mode support
	•	Integrated Simulation System: Verify toolpaths before production
	•	Automatic Optimization: Reduce machining times and improve output quality
