# CAD/CAM AI Assistant Enhancements

This is an implementation of advanced AI assistance capabilities for the CAD/CAM application, including:

## New Components

1. **Enhanced Context Collection**
   - `useEnhancedContext` hook to gather and structure contextual information
   - Provides both textual and structured context about elements, documents and environment
   - Enables smarter, more contextually aware AI responses

2. **3D Visualization**
   - `Element3dPreview` component for rendering 3D previews of CAD elements
   - Supports various element types (cube, sphere, cylinder, line, etc.)
   - Animated rotation for better visual understanding

3. **Component Preview**
   - `ComponentPreviewSection` for visualizing AI-generated CAD components
   - Displays properties and 3D previews of each element
   - Integrated with the CAD action handler

4. **Document Analysis**
   - `useDocumentAnalyzer` hook for extracting insights from context documents
   - Identifies dimensions, materials, colors, and other relevant data
   - Provides confidence scores for extracted information

5. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - `MachineLearningService` for document classification and CAD model analysis
   - Provides complexity scores and suggestions for CAD models
   - Identifies features in models like boolean operations or curved surfaces

6. **AI Component Library**
   - `aiComponentStore` for managing AI-generated components
   - Tracks favorite components, supports filtering by tags
   - Import/export capabilities for sharing components

7. **AI Dashboard**
   - Central monitoring interface showing context, stats, and insights
   - Real-time visualization of AI performance and contextual understanding
   - Interactive tabs for exploring different aspects of the AI system

## Integration with Existing Systems

- Updated the `AIContextProvider` to utilize enhanced context
- Modified the `unifiedAIService` to support structured context in requests
- Added the new tools to the `AIHub` main interface
- Enhanced all AI service requests to include rich contextual information

## Benefits

- **Improved Visualization**: Users can preview generated components before adding them to canvas
- **Richer Context**: AI understands the design environment more comprehensively
- **Reusable Components**: Save and organize AI-generated components for later use
- **Smarter Suggestions**: Context-aware recommendations based on document analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time insights into AI performance

## Directory Structure

- **Components**: 
  - `Element3dPreview.tsx` - 3D visualization component
  - `ComponentPreviewSection.tsx` - Preview panel for AI-generated components
  - `AIDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard for AI monitoring
  - `ComponentLibrary.tsx` - Interface for browsing saved components

- **Hooks**:
  - `useEnhancedContext.tsx` - Context collection and structuring
  - `useDocumentAnalyzer.tsx` - Document analysis capabilities

- **Services**:
  - `MachineLearningService.ts` - ML-based analysis tools

- **Store**:
  - `aiComponentStore.ts` - State management for AI-generated components

## Type System

The enhanced system adds several new TypeScript interfaces:

- `ContextSummary` - Structured representation of context
- `DocumentInsight` - Extracted information from documents
- `DocumentClassification` - ML-based document categorization
- `CADModelAnalysis` - Analysis of CAD model complexity and features
- `GeneratedComponent` - Structure for storing AI-generated components

## Usage

The new components are integrated into the existing AI Assistant interface. Users can:

1. Browse components in the Library tab of AIHub
2. View real-time context and performance in the Dashboard tab
3. See previews of AI-generated components before adding them to the canvas
4. Get more intelligent, context-aware responses from the AI assistant
